	<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 20%)">MY WEB OPINIONS</h1>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 30%)">•	I think Voice User Interfaces (VUI) are a prime example of innovation and what’s we will being seeing more of in the future. A voice-user interface (VUI) makes spoken human interaction with computers possible, using speech recognition to understand spoken commands and answer questions, and typically text to speech to play a reply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_user_interface">(Wiki VUI)</a>. One of the forefronts of the reasons as to why the world continues to have technological advancements is for the convenience to humans, Voice User Interfaces serves this purpose tremendously. From Siri to Alexa to Google Home, these tools are something nearly everyone I know either has or uses and the world is following this trend<a href="https://medium.com/@goodrebels/how-voice-user-interface-is-taking-over-the-world-and-why-you-should-care-54474bd56f81">(Medium -VUI)</a>. In my opinion this is the is the industry to watch and cautiously invest in.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 60%, 42%)">•	A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application">(Wiki PWA)</a>. I personally think that these PWA’s are dark horses and I’m surprised I am just really learning about them. Progressive web apps don’t require users to install using digital distribution, they have the ability to work off-line, can cross platforms between desktops and mobile devices, they don’t require separate bundling or distribution, and they work in any browser. I think PWA’s would be great for up and coming developers/ graphic designers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 80%, 45%)">•	Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet<a href ="https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-computing">(Wiki Cloud Computing)</a>. These services include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. I myself use cloud computing with storing my data, such as photos, rather than keeping files on a hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database <a href ="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud-computing.asp">(Investopedia)</a>. Something I find extremely useful when switching from device to device and pulling needed information. I think cloud computing is great and very much needed, for storing information, literature, media, etc. I think it’s convenient for personal and professional use.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 45%)">•	I am not a fan of the idea/ implementation of Connected cars. Quite frankly it is probably due to shows such as Criminal Minds and Law and Order where they have cases of people hacking into cars. A connected car is a car that can communicate bidirectionally with other systems outside of the car. This allows the car to share internet access, and hence data, with other devices both inside and outside the vehicle<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_car">(Wiki Connected Car)</a>. However, this could potentially help with the progression of self-driving cars <a href = "http://autocaat.org/Technologies/Automated_and_Connected_Vehicles">(Autocaat)</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 50%)">•	Net Neutrality, and who should control how fast a website loads is a debate I’ve had many times previous and my stance stays the same. I believe no one should govern the speed of the interenet, the internet exists outside of ,what I would believe to be, quantifiable and individual ownership. net neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">(Wiki Net Neutrality)</a>. How fast a website loads should be based on how fast the code allows it to run.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 60%)">•	Data Science, Big Data and Privacy is extremely important, and all three of these concepts work together in society. Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">(Wiki Data Science)</a>. Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">(Wiki Big Data)</a> or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy">(Wiki Privacy)</a>. I think all information that is under a clause of privacy should remain private. And any information that is not, is not. Terms and agreements are created for a reason and should be honored. I suggest law enforcement agencies to continue flag and keep track of certain words/searches. I understand that this could potentially help with crimes, but if we don’t have privacy until proven guilty then it doesn’t sit right with me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 69%)">•	Search Engine Optimization, works wonderfully for me. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of growing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">(Wiki SEO)</a>. Search engines that lists results firstly by key word matches, then maybe by how frequently the site has been visited secondly would be optimal to me. Google does have a bit of a monopoly on SEOs, however other SEOs such as BING and YAHOO have not been nearly as convenient. And above all I think us as humans are simply looking for convenience.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 75%)">•	E-commerce is apart of the future. I believe its growth is inevitable and in our best interest to join in, adapt, and apply it when necessary. E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce">(Wiki E-Commerce)</a>. Amazon should be allowed to sell its own brands to the most profitable online retail markets, as long as it is not exponentially hurting our economy. The competition is great and har to beat, but Amazon has earned it in my opinion. It is not as if they didn’t have competition greater than them when they started, it is not our place to fault them for growing so huge.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 79%)">•	I am an avid user of social media, and I believe the owners and creators of the app are allowed to profit from their creation and property. Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">(Wiki Social Media)</a>. I believe it’s only right that social media sites accept putting ads on their site for fees, given that those businesses could possibly obtain revenue in return. I honestly believe that there will soon be a different social media site that will soon surpass Facebook, maybe TikTok.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier; color:hsl(0, 100%, 82%)">•	The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">(Wiki IoT)</a>. As reading about this I was glad to see that I am not the only person concerned about privacy and security, again terms and conditions could greatly help I believe. I do think IoT is important because it generates and analyzes vast amounts of data which helps and allows us to view trends and keep track of where societies have been and where they could possibly go.</p>
